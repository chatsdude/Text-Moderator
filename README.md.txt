As of June 2019 there are now over 4.4 billion internet users. According to the latest Domo Data Never Sleeps report, Twitter users send 511,200 tweets per minute.

My goal with this project is to create a system that can tackle the problem of text or content moderation with Natural Language Processing techniques like Word Embeddings. I am currently working on creating an end-to-end application for this project.
